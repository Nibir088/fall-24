# Introduction and Motivations
Pure ($`\varepsilon`$-)differential privacy ($`\varepsilon`$-DP) ensures that the contribution of any one individual/record does not change the output of an algorithm (much). Approximate differential privacy, on the other hand, relaxes pure DP by allowing for a small failure probability $`\delta`$. This allows for more forgiving data perturbations in practice with a low failure probability.

More precisely, given any two neighboring datasets (i.e. datasets that differ by one record) $`D`$, $`D'`$ (henceforth denoted by the relation $`D\sim D'`$), an algorithm $`M:\mathcal{X}^n\to \mathcal{Y}`$ is said to be ($`\varepsilon,\delta`$)-differentially private if it satisfies for some $`\varepsilon>0`$ and $`\delta\in[0,1]`$ and $\forall\,T\in P(\mathcal{Y})$,
$$\Pr[M(X)\in T]\leq\exp(\varepsilon)\Pr[M(X')\in T] + \delta.$$
