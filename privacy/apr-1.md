# Introduction and Motivations
To recap, pure ($`\epsilon`$-)differential privacy ensures that the contribution of any one individual/record does not change the output of an mechanism (much). This requires that any neighboring datasets (i.e. datasets that differ by one record) $`D`$, $`D'`$ (henceforth denoted by the relation $`D\sim D'`$), an algorithm $`M:X\to Y`$ satisfies
